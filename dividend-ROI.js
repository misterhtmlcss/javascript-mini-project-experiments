var myLIQ = function(stockPrice, divYield, keepTime) {
    this.stockPrice = stockPrice;
    this.divYield = divYield;
    this.keepTime = keepTime;
}
stockPrice = prompt("What is the stock price? " + "");
divYield = prompt("How many shares do you get granted? " + "");
keepTime = prompt("What time period will you hold these shares? " + "");
var totalReturn = myLIQ((stockPrice * divYield) * keepTime); 
document.write(totalReturn);
Basically I had written it where it was like this too:
var myLIQ = function(stockPrice, divYield, keepTime) {
    this.stockPrice =  prompt("What is the stock price? " + "");
    this.divYield = prompt("How many shares do you get granted? " + "");
    this.keepTime = prompt("What time period will you hold these shares? " + "");
}
var totalReturn = myLIQ((stockPrice * divYield) * keepTime); 
document.write(totalReturn);
